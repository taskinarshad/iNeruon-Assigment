    "1. Define the Bayesian interpretation of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Bayesian probability is the study of subjective probabilities or belief in an outcome, compared to the frequentist approach where probabilities are based purely on the past occurrence of the event. A Bayesian Network captures the joint probabilities of the events represented by the model."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The chain rule, or general product rule, calculates any component of the joint distribution of a set of random variables using only conditional probabilities. This probability theory is used as a foundation for backpropagation and in creating Bayesian networks."

    "Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.\n",

    "\n",
    "In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that is used to show how many times an event is likely to occur over a specified period. ... The Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning that the variable can only take specific values in a (potentially infinite) list."
